# sanitizer



Building a box lined with aluminum foil and mounting this in the top of the box
is probably the best way to disinfect things quickly.


## UVC Leds Power by distance away

For a half sphere falloff:

 * $36 mW  /(4 pi * (32 cm)^2/2) * 15*60 seconds = 5 mJ/cm^2$
 * $36 mW  /(4 pi * (100 cm)^2/2) * 2.5*60*60 seconds = 5.157mJ/cm^2$
 * $36 mW  /(4 pi * (200 cm)^2/2) * 10*60*60 seconds = 5.157mJ/cm^2$
